I'm David, and I work as tech support at Lavalla Catholic College. This account holds all the code-related stuff I work on as part of my job. A lot of it is bespoke software based on the specific needs of my job and the college, but may be useful for others.

If you want to help out, pull requests and issues are welcomed on my repos. Just keep in mind that I may not fix or implement the issues or features you report, as I may not be working on that project anymore and have only published the code as a backup in case someone else from the college needs to rebuild the software.
